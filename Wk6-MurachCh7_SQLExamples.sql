--1. Create copies of tables

--Create a table named invoice_copy that contains a copy of all data in table invoices
CREATE TABLE invoices_copy AS 
  SELECT * FROM invoices;

--Remove the definition and data of table invoices_copy
DROP TABLE invoices_copy;

--Create a table named old_invoices that contains a copy of all invoices with zero balance due.
CREATE TABLE old_invoices AS 
  SELECT * 
  FROM invoices 
  WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total = 0;

--Create a table named vendor_balances, which contains each vendor's id, 
--   and the total invoice amount of all its invoices with a non-zero balance due.
CREATE TABLE vendor_balances AS 
  SELECT vendor_id, SUM(invoice_total) AS sum_of_invoices 
  FROM invoices 
  WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) <> 0 
  GROUP BY vendor_id;
  
--2. INSERT(1 Row, N Rows), COMMIT, ROLLBACK
 
--Insert a new invoice into table invoices_copy
--New invoice with invoice id: 200, vendor id 97, etc.
  INSERT INTO invoices_copy 
  VALUES (200, 97, '456789', '01-AUG-14', 8344.50, 0, 0, 1, '31-AUG-14', NULL);

--Cancel the data modification in the current transaction
--The change does not exist after you log off.
  ROLLBACK;

--Insert a new invoice into table invoices_copy with column names listed explicitly
--New invoice with invoice id: 200, vendor id 97, etc.
  INSERT INTO invoices_copy (invoice_id, vendor_id, 
        invoice_number, invoice_total, payment_total, 
        credit_total, terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due_date) 
  VALUES (200, 97, '456789', 8344.50, 0, 0, 1, '01-AUG-14', '31-AUG-14');
  
--Make the data modification in the current transaction permanent.
-- The change in the current transaction is visible to other transactions after this statement is successfuly executed.
-- The change still exists after you log off.
  COMMIT;  
  
 
--Insert a new invoice into table invoices_copy
--New invoice with invoice id: 200, vendor id 97, etc.
  INSERT INTO invoices_copy

--Cancel the data modification in the current transaction  
  ROLLBACK;

--Insert a new invoice into table invoices_copy with column names listed explicitly
--New invoice with invoice id: 200, vendor id 97, etc.
  INSERT INTO invoices_copy (invoice_id, vendor_id, 
        invoice_number, invoice_total, payment_total, 
        credit_total, terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due_date)

--Make the data modification in the current transaction permanent.
-- The change still exists after you log off.
  COMMIT;
  
--NOTE: Run all inserts into table color_sample as user EX

--color_sample table contains 3 columns:
-- color_id, color_number, color_name (listed in the same order as when the table was created)

--Each INSERT statement adds a new color into table color_sample
--Use default values for any column not having a value explicitly given.
  INSERT INTO color_sample (color_id, color_number) 
  VALUES (1, 606);     --color name: default value
  
  INSERT INTO color_sample (color_id, color_name) 
  VALUES (2, 'Yellow');  --color number: default value
  
  INSERT INTO color_sample 
  VALUES (3, DEFAULT, 'Orange');  --color number: default value
  
  INSERT INTO color_sample 
  VALUES (4, 808, NULL);  --color name: NULL
  
  INSERT INTO color_sample 
  VALUES (5, DEFAULT, NULL); --color
  
--Make the data modification in the current transaction permanent.
-- The change still exists after you log off.
  COMMIT;

--Insert N rows from other tables using subquery

--insert int table invoice_archive all invoices with a zero balance due.
INSERT INTO invoice_archive  -- without specifying column list

--equivalent to above, but with user specified column list
