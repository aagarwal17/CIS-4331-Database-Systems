--Run as user AP until another user name is mentioned.

--literal values, calculated values, operator ||, column alias

--IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
-- employees don't earn commissions
SELECT *

--vendor_address2 in table vendors uses a string value 'NULL', which is not a NULL value.
-- So IS NULL operator does not return vendors that don't have second line addresses
SELECT *

--sql set operator UNION
--This sql statement is equivalent to the above query (a full outer join), returning

--sql set operator INTERSECT
--This sql statement includes ONLY COMMON rows returned

--This sql statement is equivalent to the inner join below.

-- Returns ONLY rows returned by first query but NOT by second query.

--right outer join of 3 tables

--MIXED outer join of 3 tables
--The FROM clause is equivalent to the above query.
--e.employee_id is added to make the query easier to understand.
--The extra data: Operations department does not have an employee. So its employee_id value is NULL.
-- So the NULL value in employee_id makes the condition e.employee_id = p.employee_id evaluates to NULL.
--So Operations department is not included in the query result.
--So the right outer join cancelled the effect of left outer join.
--The ONLY extra data returned by this query are extra projects with non-matched assigned employee ids.
--This query is equivalent to the next query, which is easier to understand than this query.

--JOIN ON vs JOIN USING
--Join rows based on a matching join condition
SELECT last_name, department_name

--JOIN ON vs JOIN USING
--Join rows using specified common columns with the same names
--This query is equivalent to the above query.

--natural join
--join rows based on matching value combinations in all common columns in two tables that have the same names.
--This query is equivalent to the above two queries if the two tables only have one common column.

--Run as user UV until another user name is mentioned.

--natural join
--combine a section row with a row in takes based on a matching combination of values in all common columns

--run this query using tables in UV
--equivalent to the query above
